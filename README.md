## 🌟 Project Summary (STAR Format)

### 📌 Situation
As part of a university assignment, I was tasked with building a system that could simulate real-world showroom management functions such as handling car inventory, customer data, and sales transactions.

### 🎯 Task
Design and develop a fully functional management system using C++ that performs:
- Vehicle record management (add, update, delete)
- Customer and sales data entry
- Persistent data storage using file handling

### 🛠️ Action
- Applied **OOP principles** (classes, constructors, encapsulation)
- Implemented **file handling** for reading/writing data to text files
- Built a **menu-driven** interface to navigate features easily
- Designed modular code with separate classes for `Car`, `Customer`, and `Sale`

### ✅ Result
- Created a functional and testable application used by classmates for learning
- Strengthened my C++ skills and deepened understanding of real-world applications
- Added as a featured project on my GitHub for internship applications
