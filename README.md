# 🚗 Showroom Management System

A C++ project designed to manage vehicle inventory, employees, customers, and sales data within a vehicle showroom. This system uses Object-Oriented Programming principles like inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, and dynamic memory allocation.

### 🔹 Situation:
Vehicle showrooms often face difficulties in managing data manually, which leads to errors, inefficiencies, and lack of integration across departments.

### 🔹 Task:
The goal was to build a **console-based system** that allows:
- Adding and viewing vehicles (Cars, Bikes, EVs, Trucks)
- Managing employees and customers
- Recording and tracking sales

### 🔹 Action:
- Designed class hierarchy using **inheritance and polymorphism**
- Used **friend functions, static members**, and **operator overloading**
- Implemented dynamic memory for flexible object creation
- Developed a modular, menu-driven interface

### 🔹 Result:
- Efficiently manages over 100+ vehicles and 30+ employees
- Fast lookup, add, and delete operations
- Easy expansion with new vehicle types or employee roles

## 📌 Future To-Dos

- [ ]  Add file handling for data persistence
- [ ]  Create a GUI using Qt or WinForms
- [ ]  Expand to web using Django or Flask for backend logic
- [ ] Generate printable reports (PDFs or Excel)
- [ ]  Add user roles and authentication (Admin, Salesperson)
